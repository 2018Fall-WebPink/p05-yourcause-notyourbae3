        <h1> History of the Pitbull </h1>
        <br/>
    <p>In the 1800s in England, bulldogs were used to attack bulls or bears. This practice is called bull-baiting, which was outlawed in 1835. Soon after, dogfighting was created, with dogs being put against one anotherinstead of bulls. Some say dogfighting came to be in the United States after its development in the late 1830s and early 1840s, however others trace its history all the way back to 1817. Either way, dogfighting was definitley a popular form of entertainment in America. Eventually, dogfighting began to fall out of public favor. Sadly, ever since then, pit bulls have become associated with dogfighting and violence, causing people to view them with fear and suspicion or to stay away from them completely.  </p>

        <h2> Pitbulls: Reputation vs. Reality</h2>
        <br/>
<p> As you probably are aware, pitbulls do not have a great reputation. Between what we heave heard through media and our friends and family, they are usually known for attacking. However, most Pit Bulls are owned by many people you may know. Because of the explosion of Pit Bull breeders, thousands of Pit Bulls are ending up in shelters. This convinces people even further, making them believe that they are dangerous pets and that is why they're owners do not seem to want them, but this is not usually the case. I will not say that all pitbulls are not dangerous, however not all of them <b> are </b>dangerous! Not just pitbulls cause dog attacks. In fact, research shows that Labrador Retrievers have caused more dog attacks than Pitbulls, however, media never seems to talk about those stories.</p>
